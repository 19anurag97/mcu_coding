uart01 directory contains 2 folders
gccapplication1                     mcu-a
gccapplication2_slave               mcu-b

Both folder contains main.c file and hex file which should be needed to run proteus simulation "uart01_schema".

The path for proteus simulation project is "esp32_iot\avr328p\schematic".

Both folders consist of codes for mcu-a and mcu-b. 
Build them in microchip studio and run it on proteus to simulate uart protocol.
